# BeautifulMathWebsite

This simple website was designed to showcase the graphics rendering ability of p5.js, a javascript library. I resized the js files originally coded by Daniel Shiffman at  https://thecodingtrain.com/ , he has got a great website full of amazing art and tutorials.

The backend is set up with nodeJS and is deployed to a google cloud server at this url. https://davidingrahamf-qxmyu4b22q-uc.a.run.app 

Working with the server logic in node and adjusting my json for the app to fit the Google Cloud specifications were my biggest challenges, and Iâ€™m so grateful to demystify some parts of backend web development.
